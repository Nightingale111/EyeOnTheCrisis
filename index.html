            <h2>What Exactly Is Going On?</h2>

            <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine">source</a>

            <p>Since Russia launched a full-scale military invasion into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, 
            fighting has caused over nine hundred civilian deaths and pushed millions of Ukrainians to 
            flee to neighboring countries—the majority of whom have arrived in Poland, a NATO country 
            where U.S. troops are preparing to offer assistance to refugees.</p>
            <p>In October 2021, Russia began moving troops and military equipment near its border with 
            Ukraine, reigniting concerns over a potential invasion. Commercial satellite imagery, social 
            media posts, and publicly released intelligence from November and December 2021 showed armor, 
            missiles, and other heavy weaponry moving toward Ukraine with no official explanation. By 
            December, more than one hundred thousand Russian troops were in place near the Russia-Ukraine 
            border and U.S. intelligence officials warned that Russia may be planning an invasion for early 
            2022. In mid-December 2021, Russia's foreign ministry issued a set of demands calling for the 
            United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to cease any military activity 
            in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, to commit against further NATO expansion toward Russia, and 
            to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO in the future.  The United States and other NATO allies 
            rejected these demands and warned Russia they would impose severe economic sanctions if Russia 
            invaded Ukraine. The United States sent additional military assistance to Ukraine, including 
            ammunition, small arms, and other defensive weaponry.</p>
            <p>In early February 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered around three thousand U.S. troops 
            to deploy to Poland and Romania—NATO countries that border Ukraine—to counter Russian troops 
            stationed near its border with Ukraine and reassure NATO allies. Satellite imagery showed the 
            largest deployment of Russian troops to its border with Belarus since the end of the Cold War. 
            Negotiations between the United States, Russia, and European powers—including France and 
            Germany—did not result in a resolution. While Russia released a statement claiming to draw down 
            a certain number of troops, reports emerged of an increasing Russian troop presence at the border 
            with Ukraine. </p>
            <p>In late February 2022, the United States warned that Russia intended to invade Ukraine, citing 
            Russia's growing military presence at the Russia-Ukraine border. Russian President Vladimir Putin 
            then ordered troops to Luhansk and Donetsk, separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine partly controlled 
            by Russian-backed separatists, claiming the troops served a “peacekeeping” function. The United 
            States responded by imposing sanctions on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and the Nord Stream 2 
            gas pipeline a few days later. On February 24, during a United Nations Security Council meeting to 
            dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine, Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale land, sea, a
            nd air invasion of Ukraine targeting Ukrainian military assets and cities across the country. Biden 
            declared this attack “unprovoked and unjustified” and has since issued severe sanctions in 
            coordination with European allies targeting four of Russia's largest banks, its oil and gas industry, 
            and U.S. technology exports to the country.</p>
            <p>The United Nations, G7, EU, and other countries continue to condemn Russian actions and support 
            Ukrainian forces. In an emergency United Nations session, 141 of 193 member states voted to condemn 
            Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demanded that Russia immediately cease its use of force in Ukraine. 
            The United States has issued escalating sanctions on the financial assets of Putin and Sergey 
            Lavrov's, Russia's foreign minister, removing Russian banks from the global SWIFT financial messaging 
            system, and banning U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas. The U.S. continues to commit 
            military assistance to Ukraine; following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to 
            Congress on March 16, Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance. NATO defense 
            ministers are drafting plans to reinforce troops on the alliance's eastern flank, bringing the total 
            number of NATO troops and national armies to 180,000.</p>
            <p>Direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine continue with Zelenskyy indicating there are signs 
            of progress; however, no formal agreement has been reached. Fighting on the ground has continued in 
            and around major Ukrainian cities, with attacks on hospitals and residential complexes. Several 
            Russian long-range missile strikes have caused significant damage to Ukrainian military assets, urban 
            residential areas, and communication and transportation infrastructure. Civilians in Mariupol-a port 
            city in southeastern Ukraine-have been facing an ongoing humanitarian crisis with acute shortages of 
            food, water, and heat. Russian forces have surrounded the city for weeks with aerial bombardments 
            that have killed hundreds of civilians.</p>
